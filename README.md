# Unofficial TypeScript 7 (native) Releases

This repository contains **unofficial** binary distribution of [TypeScript 7 (native port)](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go),
built daily using GitHub Actions.
You can find the binary files at [Releases](https://github.com/sxzz/tsgo-releases/releases).

Read more about the TypeScript 7 [here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/typescript-native-port/)!

> [!WARNING]
> This is **NOT** an official distribution from the TypeScript official team.

## WASM

The WASM version is available on npm as `tsgo-wasm`.

```bash
npm install tsgo-wasm
```

## ðŸ§¯ Safety

The binaries are built through GitHub Actions using source code directly from the official TypeScript repository.
Our automated build process preserves the code integrity without any modifications.
The complete build workflow is transparent and open-source, available for inspection [here](./.github/workflows/release.yml).

We understand security concerns regarding unofficial binaries.
For additional peace of mind, you're welcome to fork this repository and execute the build workflow yourself.
